I’m Julijus  Bogomolovas, a molecular cardiology researcher at UC San Diego who spends most days studying molecular signaling that keeps our hearts beating — but I unwind by pointing those same analytical instincts at whatever catches my curiosity, from swimming training to cherry blossom prediction.\n Think of this space as my digital lab notebook crossed with a Sunday afternoon hobby shed: you’ll find expanded write-ups of data analysis from my professional work, side quests where I teach myself new statistical tricks, and plenty of “vanity” explorations that look fun. \nI’m self‑taught in much of the data‑science tooling you’ll see here, so expect the occasional misstep, frank reflections on what I learned, and code and data you’re free to borrow or improve.\n If you’re into biostatistics, all things cardiac, R notebooks that actually run, or enjoy watching a scientist learn in public, pull up a chair and join the conversation."

    "text": "Data Extraction from FIT Files\nFirst, I’ll extract swimming data from all available FIT files. The FITfileR (Smith 2025) package allows us to read Garmin workout files and identify pool swimming sessions.\n\nlibrary(FITfileR)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(utils)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(hexbin)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(gratia)\nlibrary(mgcv)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\nIdentifying Pool Swimming Sessions\nSo, one can ask Garmin to download all the files. Swim session or activity files are stored in .fit format and located in the DI_CONNECT folder, specifically in the subfolder DI-Connect-Uploaded-Files. File names are rather cryptical, so I first look for files that have “lap_swimming” attribute within.\n\n# Scan directory for all .fit files\nall_files &lt;- list.files(\"/Users/jb/Documents/BW_analysis/Swim\",\n                        pattern    = \"\\\\.fit$\",\n                        full.names = TRUE)\n\n# Check each file to identify pool swimming sessions\nn  &lt;- length(all_files)\nok &lt;- logical(n)\npb &lt;- txtProgressBar(min = 0, max = n, style = 3)\n\nfor (i in seq_along(all_files)) {\n  path &lt;- all_files[i]\n  # Safely check if file contains pool swimming data\n  ok[i] &lt;- possibly(function(p) {\n    sp &lt;- getMessagesByType(readFitFile(p), \"sport\")\n    isTRUE(any(sp$sport == \"swimming\" & sp$sub_sport == \"lap_swimming\",\n               na.rm = TRUE))\n  }, otherwise = FALSE)(path)\n  setTxtProgressBar(pb, i)\n}\n\nclose(pb)\n\npool_lap_fits &lt;- all_files[ok]\ncat(\"\\nFound\", length(pool_lap_fits), \"pool-lap swim files\\n\")\n\n\n\nExtracting Session Information\nNow, by examining several lap_swimming attributes containing files, I found that pool length in meters and activity data are stored in session, and length contains the workout information. \n\nsessions &lt;- map_dfr(pool_lap_fits, function(f) {\n  sess &lt;- tryCatch(getMessagesByType(readFitFile(f), \"session\"),\n                   error = function(e) NULL)\n  if (is.null(sess)) return(NULL)\n  tibble(\n    file          = f,\n    session_date  = as.Date(sess$start_time),\n    pool_length   = sess$pool_length\n  )\n}) %&gt;%\n  group_by(session_date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(session_number = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n# Extract individual length (lap) data\nraw_laps &lt;- map_dfr(pool_lap_fits, function(f) {\n  lengths &lt;- tryCatch(getMessagesByType(readFitFile(f), \"length\"),\n                      error = function(e) NULL)\n  if (is.null(lengths)) return(NULL)\n  lengths %&gt;% mutate(file = f)\n})"

    "text": "Statistical Modeling with GAMs\nI have something that is more or less monomodal. Therefore, my average swim speed would be a good indicator of my progress. However, in workouts, I do different sets, such as sprints, cooldowns, etc. Which vary in intensity, length, and position within the workout. I hypothesize that these factors significantly affect “average” swim speed and need to be accounted for. I don’t expect them to be linearly related, so I enter the magical world of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). I will be using mgcv (Wood 2011) for fitting, gratia (Simpson 2024) for visualization, and performance (Lüdecke et al. 2021) for model assessment. I will start with a simple speed ~ time model and try to add covariates to get a better fit, closer to “average” swim speed. As I am working with a rather large dataset, I will use the bam function and a few corresponding tweaks: discrete = TRUE and method = \"fREML\" which enables faster computation for extensive datasets. By examining the swimming speed distribution, I clearly see some tails, so I will use the scaled t-distribution family = scat(). \n\n# Model 1: Simple time trend by stroke\nsimple &lt;- bam(\n    speed ~ swim_stroke + pool_length + \n            s(days_since_start, by = swim_stroke, bs = \"gp\"),\n    data     = final_tbl_2020,\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    family   = scat(),  # Scaled t-distribution for robustness\n    method   = \"fREML\"\n)\n\n# Model 2: Add position effects (fatigue within workout/set)\nset_location &lt;- bam(\n    speed ~ swim_stroke + pool_length + \n            s(days_since_start, by = swim_stroke, bs = \"gp\") + \n            s(pos_within_workout, by = swim_stroke) +\n            s(pos_within_set, by = swim_stroke),\n    data     = final_tbl_2020,\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    family   = scat(),\n    method   = \"fREML\"\n)\n\n# Model 3: Add session random effects\nset_location_re &lt;- bam(\n    speed ~ swim_stroke + pool_length + \n            s(days_since_start, by = swim_stroke, bs = \"gp\") +\n            s(pos_within_workout, by = swim_stroke) +\n            s(pos_within_set, by = swim_stroke) +\n            s(session_id, bs = \"re\"),  # Random effect for sessions\n    data     = final_tbl_2020,\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    family   = scat(),\n    method   = \"fREML\"\n)\n\n# Compare model performance\nmodel_comparison &lt;- compare_performance(simple, set_location, set_location_re)\nprint(model_comparison)\n\n# Comparison of Model Performance Indices\n\nName            | Model |    AIC (weights) |   AICc (weights)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nsimple          |   bam | -60982.5 (&lt;.001) | -60982.4 (&lt;.001)\nset_location    |   bam | -78903.1 (&lt;.001) | -78902.5 (&lt;.001)\nset_location_re |   bam | -81777.9 (&gt;.999) | -81765.5 (&gt;.999)\n\nName            |    BIC (weights) |    R2 |  RMSE | Sigma\n----------------------------------------------------------\nsimple          | -60631.1 (&lt;.001) | 0.204 | 0.123 | 1.000\nset_location    | -78017.1 (&gt;.999) | 0.449 | 0.101 | 1.000\nset_location_re | -77560.3 (&lt;.001) | 0.475 | 0.099 | 1.000\n\nmodel_summary&lt;- summary(set_location_re)\nprint(model_summary)\n\n\nFamily: Scaled t(3.729,0.064) \nLink function: identity \n\nFormula:\nspeed ~ swim_stroke + pool_length + s(days_since_start, by = swim_stroke, \n    bs = \"gp\") + s(pos_within_workout, by = swim_stroke) + s(pos_within_set, \n    by = swim_stroke) + s(session_id, bs = \"re\")\n\nParametric coefficients:\n                          Estimate Std.

In terms of fixed effects, the model effectively captured them.  Smooth terms revealed significant nonlinear trends over time for all strokes, even when accounted for lap temporal position and session as a random factor. So let’s have a look. \n\ngratia::draw(set_location_re,select=1:4 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am getting faster with my strokes, but I am plateauing with my freestyle.

Overall, the model indicates that my backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly are improving (which I have noticed myself), while freestyle still lags behind. Extending the analysis to quartiles or deciles of lap speeds should provide a more comprehensive picture of training progress and pacing strategies."
