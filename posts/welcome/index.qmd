Hello and welcome! I’m **Julijus  Bogomolovas**, a molecular cardiology researcher at UC San Diego who spends most days studying molecular signaling that keeps our hearts beating — but I unwind by pointing those same analytical instincts at whatever catches my curiosity, from swimming training to cherry blossom prediction.

 Think of this space as my digital lab notebook crossed with a Sunday afternoon hobby shed: you’ll find expanded write-ups of data analysis from my professional work, side quests where I teach myself new statistical tricks, and plenty of “vanity” explorations that look fun. 

I’m self‑taught in much of the data‑science tooling you’ll see here, so expect the occasional misstep, frank reflections on what I learned, and code and data you’re free to borrow or improve.

 If you’re into biostatistics, all things cardiac, R notebooks that actually run, or enjoy watching a scientist learn in public, pull up a chair and join the conversation.
